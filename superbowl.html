Butler’s
 catch had the same nauseating effect on the Seahawks and their 
supporters as David Tyree’s helmet catch here seven years ago or Mario 
Manningham’s sideline grab three years ago did on the Patriots, who lost
 those Super Bowls to the Giants by a total of 7 points.

It
 spoiled the Seahawks’ repeat bid, denying them of dynasty status, and 
returned one of the league’s most successful franchises to glory. And it
 came on a play call whose merits will be debated in barrooms and 
boardrooms in the Pacific Northwest for years to come.Instead
 of handing the ball off a second straight play to Marshawn Lynch, their
 bruising running back who had already scored a touchdown, the Seahawks 
on second down elected to pass. Coach Pete Carroll accepted 
responsibility, but in the chaos afterward there seemed confusion.When
 asked whose decision it was, Wilson deflected the question. The 
offensive coordinator, Darrell Bevell, said he was comfortable with the 
choice but, considering the result, he would have liked to have called 
something different.In
 toppling Seattle, New England became the first champion to overcome a 
10-point deficit in the fourth quarter, a development that was 
remarkable and disorienting all at once. As many comebacks as Brady has 
orchestrated over his sparkling career, this one has to rank among the 
most special.Because
 it came against the swaggering Seahawks, who boasted the N.F.L.’s best 
defense and would tell anyone who asked as much. Because in its last 
eight games, all victories, Seattle had outscored its opponents by 83-13
 in the fourth quarter and overtime — and by 130-26 after halftime — in a
 stretch encompassing its stunner two weeks ago in the N.F.C. 
championship.Confronted
 with daunting circumstances, a 24-14 deficit with 12 minutes 10 seconds
 left, Brady led the Patriots to touchdowns on consecutive drives. The 
second provided the margin of victory, with Brady completing all eight 
passes, including a 3-yard toss to Julian Edelman, who had nine 
receptions for a team-high 109 yards.
“Considering
 the fact that I almost had two heart attacks,” said Edelman, still 
wearing his grass-stained jersey, “it was great.”

So
 it was, all across the Patriots’ empire Sunday night and, particularly,
 in all corners of University of Phoenix Stadium. Rob Gronkowski cut 
short an interview because he said he needed to go celebrate. Confetti 
cascaded from above. In the interview area, Darrelle Revis was chatting 
with two reporters from Japan, one of whom was wearing a pink cowboy 
hat. One asked Revis about the victory party.“It’s
 already begun,” Revis said. “But you want to come? You can come. But 
you have to bring the hat.” Then the reporter let Revis put it on.
Although
 they were asked, and although they would not say, the Patriots said 
they derived no additional satisfaction — not in their return to the 
stadium where they were denied perfection seven years ago, not after 
enduring scrutiny, their image stained, all because of footballs that 
may or may not have been intentionally deflated.For
 them, for Belichick and for Brady and for defenders everywhere of the 
Patriot Way, validation is measured by Super Bowls, and now they have 
another.Before
 the playoffs started, Wilson and Brady sent emails to a mutual friend. 
Each quarterback predicted this Super Bowl matchup, and their telepathy 
made sense: finishing his third season, Wilson is hewing to the Brady 
career arc: midround draft pick, immediate success as a starter, a title
 by age 25.The
 year after Brady won his first championship, New England did not even 
reach the playoffs, let alone return to the Super Bowl as Wilson did. 
Wilson had won his first 10 games against Super Bowl-winning 
quarterbacks, but Brady, even throwing two interceptions, dazzled, 
completing 37 of 50 passes for 328 yards and firing touchdowns to four 
receivers in winning his third Most Valuable Player award. He joined Joe
 Montana, his boyhood idol, and Terry Bradshaw as the only quarterbacks 
to win four championships, all of Brady’s coming with Belichick.“I’m
 a big Joe Montana fan — I love him to death, I thought he was the best 
and everything,” Edelman said, but, “Tom Brady came out here, he’s been 
to six Super Bowls, he’s won four with the salary cap. It’s hard to 
argue against that.”All
 week the Seahawks treated queries about Brady’s brilliance and 
LeGarrette Blount’s brawn and Gronkowski’s gronkness, about the 
Patriots’ wacky receiver-ineligible formations and chameleonic offense —
 40 rushes one game, 14 the next — and flicked them away like cigarette 
ash. Not out of arrogance, or disrespect, but the declaration, as stated
 earlier in the week by linebacker Bobby Wagner that “we do what we do 
and we do it very good.”

Confusing
 offenses is not the Seahawks’ style. They just line up in their 
three-deep coverage, with their thumping secondary, and try to impose 
their will. Usually successful, the Seahawks were not in the first half.
 Countering Seattle’s pass-rush, the Patriots ran quick passes, screens 
and pick plays, and they ran them so well that on their second 
possession Brady guided New England to the Seattle 10, on a drive that 
consumed nearly eight minutes.
Chased
 by Michael Bennett from the left side, Brady made a miserable red-zone 
decision — throwing nowhere near a receiver, and right into the hands of
 Jeremy Lane at the goal line. The interception prevented one touchdown,
 but it indirectly produced another.
On
 his return, Lane, the Seahawks’ nickel cornerback, sustained an arm 
injury. Tharold Simon replaced him, and on the Patriots’ next possession
 Brady exposed him. First with a 24-yard pass to Edelman, zipping across
 the middle, and then, two plays later, with a perfect slant to Brandon 
LaFell, whose 11-yard touchdown put New England ahead, 7-0.For
 the Seahawks, their offensive malaise — three series, one first down — 
evoked the first 58 minutes of their last game, the N.F.C. championship 
victory against the Packers. Nothing Seattle tried, from Lynch’s 
interior running to dropbacks by Wilson that were thwarted by the 
Patriots’ superb downfield coverage, seemed to work.Until
 Wilson found a matchup he liked and exploited it, connecting deep down 
the right sideline with Chris Matthews, whose onside kick recovery two 
weeks ago proved he had excellent hands. Matthews reached over Kyle 
Arrington and fell backward while hauling in his first career catch, a 
44-yarder that set up Lynch’s 3-yard touchdown run with 2:16 left in the
 first half.
That
 was far too much time on the clock for Brady, who dissected the 
Seahawks as if slowly pulling off a Band-Aid — with short passes to 
Shane Vereen — before yanking it off with a 22-yard touchdown fade to 
Gronkowski with 31 seconds remaining.

But
 that was also far too much time for Wilson, who has developed a 
reputation for clutch passing himself. He drove the Seahawks 80 yards in
 29 seconds, a series keyed by a 23-yard pass to Ricardo Lockette and 
10-yard personal foul on Arrington. With the ball at the New England 11 
and six seconds left before halftime, Carroll had a choice: attempt a 
field goal or run one final play.Nothing
 about the Seahawks’ aggressive personality suggested they would play it
 safe, and Wilson whipped a pass on the outside to the 6-foot-5 
Matthews, who exploited his 6-inch height advantage over Logan Ryan, for
 an 11-yard touchdown that evened the score at 14-14 heading into 
halftime.

The
 Seahawks, masters of the second half and the fourth quarter, were in 
the middle of reeling off 17 straight points. They were in control until
 they were not — a feeling New England knew all too well, and returned 
when Seattle took over with 2:02 to play at its own 20.Three
 plays after Wilson opened the drive by throwing a 31-yard pass to Lynch
 down the left sideline, Jermaine Kearse made a catch to rival Tyree’s 
on this same field in 2008 — defended by Butler, Kearse had the ball 
bounce off both thighs and his lower arm before he corralled it at the 
New England 5.“I
 didn’t have any doubt,” receiver Doug Baldwin said. “At that time, you 
didn’t think there was anyone on the sideline who didn’t think we’d 
score.”After
 a 4-yard run by Lynch, the Seahawks lined up in a three-receiver set. 
Based on the formation, Butler said he recognized before the snap that 
Seattle was running a play intended to beat man-to-man coverage. It 
forced the cornerbacks to line up tight, Butler said.


As
 Carroll explained it, he did not want to waste a running play against 
New England’s goal-line defense — he wanted to save that for third and 
fourth downs, if necessary.Split
 out wide were Kearse and Lockette, who stood a few yards behind him and
 a step to his right. Even though Wilson’s head was not moving, Butler 
read his eyes, which were scanning in that direction.“When
 they made the call, I didn’t question it,” said Wilson, who finished 12
 of 21 for 247 yards. He added: “We thought we had them. I thought it 
was going to be a touchdown when I threw it. When I let it go, I thought
 it was going to be game over.”









“It’s
 going to kill me,” Seattle linebacker Bruce Irvin said. “I think I’m 
about to just go lock myself in my room for about two weeks. This one 
hurt because we had it. We had it.”The
 Seahawks will recover. They are too young, too resilient and too 
talented. But they also lost in perhaps the cruelest way possible, to a 
team that once specialized in crushing defeats but no more.
        
                                
    
                                


    
    
                                








                        

















































































Look,
 everyone in the entire world knew that Lynch was going to get the ball.
 Everyone. And the Pats had stopped him several times.So, why not do
 what no one in the entire world expects -- a quick pass just over the 
goal line? If it worked, Pete Carroll would be a football genius. If it 
went incomplete, now you have the Pats wondering if you'll do it again 
or go with Lynch, and slow the defenders a half-step, which is all Lynch
 would need.



























Three things can happen when you throw the 
football and two of them are bad.  An absolutely ridiculous play call in
 that situation, and the result was, statistically speaking, 
predictable.Too bad for Seattle, and New England gets the win.  And 
the chorus of "what if's" will be loud and resounding.  In Seattle, 
anyway.





























My big question is where Wilson goes from here. 
 He was mediocre tonight.   This will be a true test of his character.  
He'll probably land on his feet.  But mark my words, the critics won't 
give him as much time as he deserves if he falters.  Brady's  two Super 
Bowl losses weighed on him for years.  Now, they'll proclaim him the 
best ever.  The critics are fickle.  They expect the impossible.  Wilson
 could be on the hot seat before long.  Everyone loves a winner.  Not so
 much second place.  



























The thing is, if Seattle gives the ball to 
Lynch, the Patriots probably would have had to LET him score, so as to 
be able to get the ball back and give Brady 50 seconds or so to go 
length of the field...Shows how difficult it really is to win a 
championship (in any sport), so many things can happen, momentum can 
shift so quickly, etc....The drama of sports, it beats the drama of most
 movies and TV shows...





























I'm a Pats fan.  Their time of possession 
dominance in the first half spoke loud to me.  So did the fact that 
Seattle scored 2 TD's off of turnovers.  When the Pats fell behind by 
10, I expected them to lose.  But they hadn't been outplayed at that 
point.  So 10 down was bad, but not over.  In the end, I thought it was a
 toss-up.  The freak catch sealed a Pats loss.  The interception sealed a
 victory.  I'd give the first half to the Pats and the second half to 
the Hawks.  And I'd attribute the Pats victory to that one play, which 
could have gone either way.



























This is a perfect example of a classic mistake 
that spectators make: judging a coach by an outcome, which is out of a 
coach's control, rather than by a decision, which is in a coach's 
control.After
 Kearse's miracle catch, Seattle had 1:06 remaining with two timeouts. 
Lynch's run to the 1-yard line forced them to burn a second timeout, 
leaving Seattle with only one timeout remaining and less than a minute 
to play.So suppose you've got three downs, one timeout, less 
than a minute, and one yard to deal with for the championship. The 
question that goes through your mind should be, "What happens if we run 
on second down and get stuffed?" There are two answers: (1) you burn 
about 15 seconds to hurry-up to your next play, which, if unsuccessful, 
leads to you using your last timeout before your last shot at the 
championship. (2) You burn your timeout after the run on second down and
 then are forced to hurry-up to fourth down if the third down play 
doesn't convert. Either way, you don't have an opportunity to plan for 
one of those downs.Carroll claims that the matchup of Lynch 
against the New England goal line defense would probably have led to 
their RB getting stuffed, which means Seattle has to deal with all of 
the above. If that's true, then he made the correct DECISION, which was 
to pass. If it converts, great. If it doesn't, then the clock is 
stopped, and you have time to plan the last two downs.



























In Carroll's defense, I've seen the Seahawks 
complete those short slant passes near the goal line all season.   I'm 
sure he regrets it now - but had it worked (and it was close) he'd have 
been sung a genius by some for having surprised the Patriot defenders.



























I love all these back and forth comments. I 
started out watching the game, not caring about which side won, only 
hoping for a good game. I got my wish and then some. I also ended up 
rooting for Brady. He's a class act and I wanted him up there with 
Montana and Bradshaw. 


























A native Bostonian joyfully celebrates the 
Patriots'  fourth Super Bowl title and vindication of Coach Bill 
Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. Multiple subtexts abound. XLIX was 
perhaps the finest of all. The NFL endured a horrendous year from a 
public relations standpoint. The Patriots are a team that countless 
millions of fans despise. In the glow of my joy, two things stand out: 
1. Richard Sherman's great show of sportsmanship to nemesis to Tom Brady
 at the end, and 2. Pete Carroll's play call just moments before. I hope
 Seahawks fans will appreciate Coach Carroll 's tremendous contribution 
to that franchise. His gamble failed; that does not make him an evil 
man. There was a flaw in the plan that he could not foresee. He should 
not be crucified. I truly hope that Seattle will clutch him to its 
breast with, as William Shakespeare wrote, "hoops of steel."
